        <p>If you're applying for a Funza Lushaka bursary in South Africa, you may be wondering about the approval timeline. This article will help you understand the process and give you an idea of how long you might need to wait for a decision.</p>

        <div class="alert">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Approval times can vary depending on various factors, including the number of applications received and the complexity of individual cases. The information provided here is based on general trends and official guidelines.
        </div>

        <h2>What is the Funza Lushaka Bursary?</h2>
        <p>The Funza Lushaka Bursary Programme is a multi-year program that promotes teaching in public schools. It was established by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to address the shortage of qualified teachers in South Africa, particularly in priority areas.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The bursary covers tuition, accommodation, meals, learning materials, and a small stipend. In return, recipients are required to teach at a public school for the same number of years they received the bursary.
        </div>

        <h2>The Funza Lushaka Application Process</h2>
