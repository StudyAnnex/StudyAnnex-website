        <p>If you're considering applying for or have been awarded a Funza Lushaka bursary, you may be wondering about your options for choosing where to teach. This article will help you understand the placement process and what factors influence where you might be assigned to teach.</p>

        <div class="alert">
            <strong>Important:</strong> The Funza Lushaka bursary comes with a service obligation. Recipients are required to teach at a public school for the same number of years they received the bursary, plus one additional year.
        </div>

        <h2>What is the Funza Lushaka Bursary?</h2>
        <p>The Funza Lushaka Bursary Programme is a multi-year program that promotes teaching in public schools. It was established by the Department of Basic Education to address the shortage of qualified teachers in South Africa, particularly in priority areas such as mathematics, science, and technology.</p>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The bursary covers tuition, accommodation, meals, learning materials, and a small stipend. In return, recipients commit to teaching in a public school after graduation.
        </div>

        <h2>Can You Choose Where to Teach?</h2>
        <p>While Funza Lushaka bursary recipients have some input in their placement, the final decision is typically made by the provincial education departments. Here's what you need to know about the placement process:</p>
