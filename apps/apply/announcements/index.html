          Dear Study Annex Users,
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope this message finds you well. We're writing to inform you about an important update to our university application app.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What's Changing
        </h3>
          We've made the difficult decision to discontinue our service of submitting university applications on behalf of students. We understand this may cause inconvenience, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause to your application plans, especially to those that did not received updates regarding their applications.
          <br/>
          To compensate for this unfortunate decision, we have added a new feature to keep making the application process easy for you.
        
        <h3>
          New Feature
        </h3>
        
          To continue supporting you and making the university application easy, we've introduced a new feature that lets you apply directly on each university's application page. This update aims to streamline your application process while giving you more control over your submissions.
        
        <h3>
          Action Required
        </h3>
        
          To access this new feature and ensure you have the best experience with Study Annex:

          <ol>
            <li>Update your app to the latest version</li>
            <li>Explore the new direct application links in the "University Applications" section</li>
          </ol>
          We believe this change will ultimately provide a more efficient and personalized application experience for all our users.
        

        <h3>
          Our Commitment
        </h3>
          At Study Annex, we're committed to supporting you. We appreciate your understanding as we work to improve our services and provide the best tools for your future.

		  Hey there!
    </p>
		<p>
		  Great news! ?? We've updated the prospectuses within the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apply.to.university.the.study.annex">Apply to Uni</a> app with the latest information for the upcoming academic year.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Now you can access the most up-to-date details on programs, admission requirements, and other crucial information for your chosen universities.
		</p>
		<p>
		  However, we're still working with a few universities that haven't yet provided their updated prospectuses. We're actively following up with them and will update the app as soon as their information becomes available.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In the meantime, please head over to the app store and download the latest update of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apply.to.university.the.study.annex">Apply to University</a>. This will ensure you have access to the most recent prospectuses.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay and appreciate your patience. We're committed to providing you with the most accurate and comprehensive information.
		</p>
