          Hey there!
        </p>
        <p>
          We're thrilled you're using our app to apply to your future University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the university prospectuses within the app reflect last year's information. We understand this might cause confusion and frustration, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest assured, we're working hard to update the prospectuses with the latest information from each university. You can expect the updated versions to be available within the app in the coming days. We'll send another notification when they're live!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, you can still browse universities, compare programs, and submit applications for you and your friends using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your understanding and patience. We're committed to providing the most accurate and helpful resources for you.ðŸ’™
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
