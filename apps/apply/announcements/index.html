		  Hey there!
		<p/>
		<p>
		  Great news! ðŸŽ‰ We've successfully updated the prospectuses within the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apply.to.university.the.study.annex">Apply to Uni</a> app with the latest information for the upcoming academic year.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Now you can access the most up-to-date details on programs, admission requirements, and other crucial information for your chosen universities.
		</p>
		<p>
		  However, we're still working with a few universities that haven't yet provided their updated prospectuses. We're actively following up with them and will update the app as soon as their information becomes available.
		</p>
		<p>
		  In the meantime, please head over to the app store and download the latest update of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apply.to.university.the.study.annex">Apply to University</a>. This will ensure you have access to the most recent prospectuses.
		</p>
		<p>
		  We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay and appreciate your patience. We're committed to providing you with the most accurate and comprehensive information.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Best regards,
		</p>

          Hey there!
        </p>
        <p>
          We're thrilled you're using our app to apply to your future University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the university prospectuses within the app reflect last year's information. We understand this might cause confusion and frustration, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest assured, we're working hard to update the prospectuses with the latest information from each university. You can expect the updated versions to be available within the app in the coming days. We'll send another notification when they're live!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, you can still browse universities, compare programs, and submit applications for you and your friends using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your understanding and patience. We're committed to providing the most accurate and helpful resources for you.ðŸ’™
